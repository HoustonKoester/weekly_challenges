    //A watch, which loses time uniformly, was observed to be 5 minutes fast at 8.00 p.m. on Thursday.
    // It was noticed to be 7 minutes slow at 8.00 a.m. on the subsequent Monday.
    // When did the watch show the correct time ? Explanation needed.
    //
    //a) 7 a.m. Saturday b) 7 a.m. on Friday
    //
    //c) 10a.m. on Sunday d) 11 a.m. on Friday


    //Explaination

    // hours between 8 PM on Thursday and 8 AM of Monday = 84

    //total time the watch changed = 12 minutes, trying to find 5 minutes of change = 5/12

    // Answer = (5/12) * 84 + Thursday's time => 35 + 8pm thursday => 11 + 8pm Friday => 7 + 12am Saturday = 7am Saturday
